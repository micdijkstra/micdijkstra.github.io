    <p>Hi, I'm Michael Dijkstra.</p>
    <p>I want to use my broad range of skills and experience to help change the world with charity: water.</p>

    <img src="timeline.jpg" alt="Timeline of Startups">

    <p>I currently work as Head of Product for PwC Australia’s Create Digital practice where I oversee product development for various businesses, including <a href="http://asku.com.au">AskU</a>, a free way to support charity in under 30 seconds a day.</p>

    <p>Before PwC I founded my own startup, <a href="http://storyberg.com">Storyberg</a>, worked on a number of different startups as a Lean Product Manager for <a href="http://pollenizer.com">Pollenizer</a> and started <a href="/posts/ninety9bottles">Ninety9Bottles</a>, an online wine company and wine label.</p>

    <p>As a founder and Product Manager I’ve learnt how to run agile teams using Lean Startup Methodology, focus, set priorities, be self-motivated and launch products.</p>

    <p>As a developer I’ve learnt how to build web and mobile apps, test drive my development, embrace new technologies and ship features, fast.</p>

    <p>You can see <a href="/work/">how I work</a> and <a href="/work#built">what I've built</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">I believe in charity: water</h2>

    <p>After discovering charity: water through Kevin Rose’s interview of Scott Harrison on Foundation, I donated my birthday and raised $104.</p>

    <div class="card"><img src="wishingwell.jpg" alt="Wedding Wishing Well Flyer"></div>

    <p>Last year when I got married, instead of having a wishing well we decided to build a real well instead, and raised $7,115.</p>

    <div class="card"><img src="mothersday.jpg" alt="Mothers Day Email"></div>

    <p>After reading Mulitani's story I donated $40 instead of buying my mum flowers, although because I didn’t organise it until Mothers Day I had to create my own email card (this is the best I could do with Gmail).</p>

    <div class="card"><img src="jambox.jpg" alt="charity: water jambox"></div>

    <p>If I could, I would have purchased a charity: water Jambox, but they won’t ship to Australia :(</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">I'm ready to change the world</h2>

    <p>I’ve worked for a number of startups claiming to change the world, but working for charity: water would be my first opportunity to really change the world.</p>

    <p>I know charity: water will have its challenges, but they’re challenges I’m ready to take on. I also know working remotely from Sydney would be challenging, but if there’s a fit, I’d be willing to move to New York.</p>

    <p>If you want to find out more <a href="/">about me</a> and <a href="/work">what I’ve done</a>, you can <a href="http://twitter.com/micdijkstra">follow me on Twitter</a>, <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/micdijkstra/">browse my LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:michael@dijkstra.io">get in touch</a>.</p>
