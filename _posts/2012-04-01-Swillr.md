The idea for Swillr was, unsurprisingly, born over a few beers on a Friday night after work. Wanting to find a good deal for beers nearby, we came up with the idea to build an app that shows you where the nearest happy hour is.

Before building a native app we decided to test the idea quickly by building a responsive HTML5 web app.

The beer icons indicate what stage the happy hour is at. A full beer means it hasn’t started yet, a half finished beer means it’s half way through and an empty beer means you’ve missed out!

At launch we had 50+ happy hours listed in Sydney, conveniently around our work.
