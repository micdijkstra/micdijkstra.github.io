[Two Hands](http://playtwohands.com) started after a discussion with a few guys who have built a successful multi-player gaming platform. The ambitious idea is to build a platform for a brand to create a Guiness World Record by hosting the biggest rock-paper-scissors tournament!

Two Hands, my first iOS game, started as a prototype but quickly evolved into an MVP and was recently launched to the [App Store](http://bit.ly/PlayTwoHands) as a modern take on the classic rock-paper-scissors,  pitting friends and strangers against each other in a quest to build the longest winning streak.

Working off a few rough sketches I put together, [CJ Lofstrom](http://cjlofstrom.com) designed the initial layout, look and feel for Two Hands. I built the iOS application using Rubymotion and the back-end API in Rails.

Users login with Facebook, and choose to challenge their friends or play a random opponent. While competing to build the longest winning streak, players can gain a competitive advantage by upgrading to see stats and their opponent's last five throws.

With no marketing budget, we soft-launched the app by putting up a landing page at [playtwohands.com](http://playtwohands.com) and sharing via our Facebook and Twitter networks. Weâ€™re continuing to have discussions with brands to ultimately create the largest rock-paper-scissors tournament in history, so please [get in touch](mailto:michael@dijkstra.io) if you or your company are interested.
