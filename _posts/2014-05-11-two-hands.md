[Two Hands](http://playtwohands.com) is a modern take on the classic rock-paper-scissors, pitting friends and strangers against each other in a quest to build the longest winning streak.

After a brief discussion around gameplay I put together wireframes which [CJ Lofstrom](http://cjlofstrom.com) used to design the layout, look and feel for the app.

Users login with Facebook, and choose to challenge their friends or play a random opponent.

While competing to build the longest winning streak, players can gain a competitive advantage by upgrading to see stats and their opponent's last five throws.

Two Hands, my first iOS game, was built using Rubymotion powered by a Ruby on Rails API.
