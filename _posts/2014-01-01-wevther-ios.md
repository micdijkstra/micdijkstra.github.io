The day before was tough. I still remember the moment I pressed send on an email to all the mentors of [Startmate](http://startmate.com.au) informing them [Storyberg](http://storyberg.com) would be no more. I explained how we weren’t able to validate demand for our solution and we couldn’t identify a direction to pivot.

Now I found myself sitting on the couch pondering my next move. I had always wanted to learn to build iOS apps but didn’t have the time. Now I did, so I purchased a licence for RubyMotion and started working my way through getting started guides and tutorials.

After a few hours I had a couple of basic apps under my belt, and as before, I didn’t know what to do next. I knew I didn’t want to create a new startup, I wasn’t driven to make money, I just wanted to build an app that people would use.

A year earlier I discovered a little site called [Wevther](http://wevther.com). Wevther was a forecast site that not only showed you the temperature for the day, but also made suggestions for what to wear. I was always a fan of the ‘jobs to be done’ thinking behind the site (you really wan’t to know what the weather will be so you know what to wear) and remembered they didn’t have an iPhone app. When I first visited their site I remember reading on their info tab they were looking to collaborate with an iOS developer. This message was on the site for over a year but seeing as I hadn’t heard or seen any release, I saw an opportunity.

I spent the next day working on a prototype. That evening I sent an email to [Jacob](http://jacobheftmann.com) and [Jack](http://jack.ly) at Wevther. I introduced myself, attached a few screenshots and made a 20 second screencast to show how the app works.

The next morning, lying in bed, I nervously reached for my phone to see if they had responded.

<blockquote>
Holy shit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(excuse me)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael,<br>
<br>
Waking up to your mail made my day. It’s funny timing because I got an email the day before with the same subject line — it was very nice but way less useful/exciting.
</blockquote>

Luckily for me, they loved it. After exchanging a few exciting emails we started working together. There was no need for any formal agreements because we were all comfortable working on Wevther as a labour of love and if something did come of it one day, we’d split it three ways.

Over the next six months we collaborated together when we weren’t working full-time or servicing freelance clients. Jacob focussed on designs and Jack built the API while I focused on the iOS app. It wasn’t until the designs were being finalised that Jacob and I had our first conversation over Skype to discuss interactions, everything up to that point had been done over email. We shared updates via TestFlight and tracked issues and enhancements in GitHub. Through the entire process, the fact we were on opposite sides of the world was never an issue.

We launched [Wevther to the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wevther/id723686546?mt=8) in October 2012 with a marketing budget of $0 and by the end of the year we had almost a thousand people download the app (we’re well over that now). For a little side project, we considered this a success.

Jacob  made a little video to show off the app and highlight push notifications, something that wasn’t available through the web.
