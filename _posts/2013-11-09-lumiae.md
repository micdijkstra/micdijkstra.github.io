[Lumiae](http://lumiae.com) is a Ruby on Rails application for a custom made jewellery startup
which guides customers through curated list of beautiful designs to find inspiration for their idea
before  before matching them with a designer to bring their concept to life
and commission a custom piece to be made.

The logo was designed by [CJ Lofstrom](http://cjlofstrom.com) and I was
responsible for the user experience, product design and development of the
application.

The process starts by asking a few questions about the person the piece of jewellery is for.

The customer is then shown a selection of designs based on their look, style and
type.

When the customer submits their brief they are matched with a designer who
creates a 3D model of the design, refines the concept and ultimately 
confirms an order to comission the piece to be made.
