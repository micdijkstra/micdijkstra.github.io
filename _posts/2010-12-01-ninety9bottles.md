[Andy Clarke](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) had just released
[Hardboiled Web Design](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com) which inspired me to
design and develop my first responsive website.

In addition to the branding and website, we also created a
monthly specials email and a series of spin papers to accompany the quarterly
dozen packs.
