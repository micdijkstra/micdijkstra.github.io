List App is the easiest way to create, share and collaborate lists online.

List App was born out of a personal need to easily create and share todos with
clients. I found that even a product like Basecamp had too many features for
what I was trying to achieve.

List App was the first ever Ruby on Rails application I built and is backed by MongoDB.
