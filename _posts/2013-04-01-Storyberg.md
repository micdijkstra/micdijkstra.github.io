During my time working on a number of startups during my time at [Pollenizer](http://pollenizer.com) I was never happy with the tools we used to manage our startups, and out of this pain, Storyberg was born. Storyberg was a Lean Product Management tool which I co-founded with [Kevin Nguyen](http://twitter.com/saltysealion).

[CJ Lofstrom](http://cjlofstrom.com) did the initial branding including
designing the Storyberg mascot, Stanley.

Over a year and a half, Storyberg took many different shapes and disguises but
one thing remained constant, we were trying to solve the problem of validating whether or not you're building something people want.

Storyberg started as a project management tool, essentially a Kanban Board with
a validated swimlane and fields to capture learnings.

As we learnt from potential customers we pivoted into more of an analytics play,
trying to help businesses measure their key metrics against releases to learn
which changes were making an impact.

We applied for, and were lucky enough to be accpeted into the [Startmate 2012
program](http://www.startmate.com.au/announcing-the-2012-startmate-class).

Unfortunately, we weren't able to find a differentiating edge for Storyberg and
made the call to close it down in the middle of March 2013.
