    <p>Over the years I have worked with a number of different small teams, as a freelancer, co-founder or employee; in design, development and product management roles.</p>

    <p>I am drawn to working on products which solve real problems and know that most of the time you have to say no to 1,000<sup class="footnoted"></sup> things in order to focus on solving something well.</p>

    <p>While working I enjoy finding new ways of doing things and look to improve processes and build tools to improve my workflow.</p>

    <p>I take every opportunity I can to work with like-minded people, so if you're working on something you think I might find interesting, <a href="http://twitter.com/micdijkstra/">let me know</a>.</p>
